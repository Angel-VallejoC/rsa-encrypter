### About

This is a simple Java GUI application that implements the RSA algorithm to 
encrypt and decrypt the content of a text file.  
The public and private keys are generated every time the program is
accessed so the program can only encrypt and decrypt files successfully
when these actions are performed in the same session.  

This is a homework for the class Virology and Cryptology at UPIICSA.

### How to run

Run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Angel-VallejoC/rsa-encrypter.git
cd rsa-encrypter/src
javac Login.java
java Login
```

### Access the program
Credentials for the program are hard coded in SHA since this is just 
an example on how to use RSA in Java and it was required to have
a login screen for one user.
The credentials are as follows:  
USER: "VIROLOGIA"  
PASSWORD: "4NV70"
